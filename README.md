i.    The role of the permanent magnet in a motor is used only in smaller DC motors.The PM is radially magnetized, with north and south poles alternating along the circumference of a rotor. It is used to rotate a motor, without the use of teeth-like projections, although it is less precise than a hybrid motor.

ii.   The role of the brushes in a DC motor is to help maintain contact with the power source, by loosely connecting power from the terminals and brushing up onto the commutator.

iii.  I would use a servo motor to rotate the proximity sensor to scan the room. It's a great motor for precise movement. Using an optical encoder for feedback, the motor can be controlled more smoothly (and typically much more precisely) detecting how much the disc has rotated.
